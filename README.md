- This is my year 1 semester 1 and also my first programming project.
- The title of my project is "Lucky Hotel".
- We provide the register, login and logout methods for the customers and administrators.
- We have not used database, just use input and output file methods.
- We have designed the GUI with javaFx with the SceneBuilder.
